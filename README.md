## &#x1F534; Introduction
Sutton is the name of [the game!](https://main--trevor4n-sutton.netlify.app/) Users must think fast as they play a game of memory. Each round, a random **fruity** sequence is displayed to the player. Players must repeat the pattern using a fantastic input pad. Players can try their best to memorize longer and more challenging streaks!

## &#x1F534; MVP User Stories
 - [x] As a player, I want to be able to start a new game, so that I can play multiple times in a row.
 - [x] As a player, I want the game to light up a sequence of input pads, so that I have a pattern to reproduce.
 - [x] As a player, I want the game to animate the pads, so that I know my moves are registered.
 - [x] As a player, I want the game to track my score, so that I know how good my memory is and how long the pattern has become.
 - [x] As a player, I want the game to alert me when I make a mistake, so that I know the game is over.

## &#x1F534; Major Hurdles
The biggest hurdle I overcame this project was ensuring there would be no animation clipping (due to asynchronous code). I was able to ensure that when the game sequence is displayed, animations don't overlap.  I also made sure that the user can play quickly and that the animations don't prevent input during their turn from being rejected. I implemented multiple tactics to satisfy animation timing requirements. That includes Promise statements, setTimeout functions, and async await calls.

*This project also served as a formal introduction to css... my first front-end UI!*

### &#x1F535; Stretch Goals (Not Mandatory):
- [x] Mobile friendly layout
- [x] Adjustable difficulty (user can increase the quantity of unique memory pads)
- [ ] Integrate 3rd party API
- [ ] Colorblind mode
